  <h1 style="text-align: center;">About ResurgeJustice</h1>

  <p><strong>ResurgeJustice</strong> is a nonprofit initiative committed to helping formerly incarcerated individuals rebuild their lives through employment, skill development, mentorship, and access to legal and community resources.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We strive to break down barriers and empower justice-impacted individuals with the tools they need to reintegrate into society. Our platform connects returning citizens to job opportunities, personal development programs, and a network of mentors and advocates who believe in second chances.</p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>We envision a world where everyone — regardless of their past — is given the opportunity to thrive, contribute meaningfully, and build a stable future. ResurgeJustice believes in dignity, inclusion, and the power of community-led transformation.</p>

  <h2>What We Offer</h2>
  <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Job Listings:</strong> Curated roles from employers who support second-chance hiring.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Personalized guidance from professionals and advocates who understand the journey.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Resources for building resumes, learning new trades, and preparing for success.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal & Community Support:</strong> Access to reentry services, housing help, and legal aid organizations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>1 in 3 Americans has a criminal record. Many face lifelong stigma and barriers — especially in employment. At ResurgeJustice, we believe a mistake shouldn't define a person forever. With support, opportunity, and community, reentry can be a launchpad — not a setback.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: center;"><em>Together, we’re not just reducing recidivism — we’re reigniting hope.</em></p>
